# YOLOv2-Implementation
Implementation of YOLOv2 based on Coursera course "Convolutional Neural Networks" week 3 assignment provided by deeplearning.ai

#Changes to original notebook:
1. using cv2 to read output images
2. automatically adapt input images size
3. using for loop to detect all the test images in the folder

#Some test images:
